**Book You DonÂ´t Know Javascript jet (YDKJSJ)**

- The path. read every chapter and and read again trying to solve some of the exercises
- large concepts is important for digesting to re-reading, practicing and digesting some more
- be patient with the way the reader learn from this book

_Primitive values_

- stay in mind that Null returns and Object insead of null
- "Coercion" is the action of convert from one value type to another

  _Variables_

- working with 'var' and 'let' has its differences. 'var' is to the global scope. 'let' is block-scope. generate errors if not well declared
- coprisson betwee '==' and '===' operators
- coercion comparisons. important to understand because always is compared with primitive vlues
- Objects and classes: is the way that JS suggest organize code using Class Pattern:
  - Inheritance
- Modules: methods are ecplicity exposed as public and is posible to export only defined functions
  - create modules or variables or methods with 'Export' and 'Import' to use this when is neccesary.
- Iterator: use Map and set, get to work with objects and cache functions
- closure: very usefull to avoid performace issues
- This Keyword: characteristic of function execution. tight to the scope of the function wrraped excepts for arrow functions.
- Prototypes: characteristic of Object and linked to objects. when object is created is linked to another that already exists
  that is called "prototype chain"
